Hardware files and firmware for RADIANT

FPGA pinout still mostly nonsense. :(

# Bill of Materials

Online BOM is here:

https://octopart.com/bom-tool/gPKJbAbm

The online BOM contains only ICs at the current moment. See full BOM for
passives. Note that the refdes column is set to "shrink to fit" for width
so they don't make it easy to read in Excel! When exporting to anything
else it should work fine.

# Passive notes

The 4.7 uF 0402 caps should have a 6.3V rating.
The 10 uF 0603 caps should have a 10V rating.
The 100 uF 1206 cap should have at least a 4V rating.
The 47 uF 0805 caps should have at least a 6.3V rating.
All other caps should be easy to find with at least a 10V rating, I think.
